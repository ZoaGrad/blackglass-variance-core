# NIST AI Safety Institute: Unified Compliance Proposal
## Proposal for the 'Blackglass Guardian' Framework Integration (AI RMF 1.1)

**Document ID:** 0xUNIFIED_NIST_SUBMISSION  
**Version:** 0.06V (Ecosystem Ready)  
**Status:** ✅ FINAL_PROPOSAL

### I. Executive Summary: From Protocol to Framework
While the **Variance Protocol (0.05V)** provides the mathematical standard for semantic safety, the **Blackglass Guardian Stack** provides the first complete, high-agency implementation of the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)** for production-level sovereign systems.

We propose the recognition of the **Blackglass Unified Ecosystem** as a recommended architecture for organizations deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) and Autonomous Agents in high-stakes environments (Finance, Healthcare, Defense).

### II. Ecosystem-to-RMF Mapping
The Blackglass ecosystem directly implements the four functions of the NIST AI RMF:

| RMF Function | Blackglass Component | Control Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GOVERN** | `Vector_Null / Sentinel` | Constitutional "Lex" (0.05V) and Human-Agency (Mercy Protocol). |
| **MAP** | `Blackglass Sentinel` | Entropy Vector Scanning to identify context-specific semantic drift. |
| **MEASURE** | `Guardian / ScarIndex` | Real-time quantification of Ache, ScarIndex, and Semantic Variance. |
| **MANAGE** | `Shard Auditor / ARE` | Auto-Regulation Engine and hard-coded Auditor Interdiction (Hard Stops). |

---

### III. Core Control Propositions

#### 1. The 0.05V Semantic Anchor (MEASURE)
Recognize **Semantic Variance (V)** as the primary metric for LLM reliability. 
- **Standard:** $V < 0.05$.
- **Evidence:** Case Study 001 (Air Canada) - Variance monitoring would have prevented the hallucinated bereavement policy by detecting high epistemic instability.

#### 2. The Mercy Protocol for Human Agency (GOVERN)
Propose **"Operator Resilience Monitoring"** as a required security control.
- **Control:** Autonomous defense systems MUST detect responder fatigue (e.g., 23:00 - 07:00 local time) and execute pre-authorized protective measures (sentinel_lockdown) to prevent human-error-driven system failure.

#### 3. Automated Risk Interdiction (MANAGE)
Propose mandatory **"Financial Hard-Stop Auditing"** for autonomous agents.
- **Control:** Independent of the primary AI strategy, a deterministic "Auditor" node must monitor capital health. A variance of >0.05 in portfolio drawdown triggers an immediate `FORCE_SELL` override, bypassing the probabilistic AI logic.

### IV. Reference Implementation: The Guardian Stack
The **Guardian Stack v2** (specifically Phase 8.4) serves as the reference implementation for these controls. Its SQL-based "ScarIndex" provides a persistent, forensic record of agent behavior, satisfying the RMF's requirements for **Accountability and Transparency**.

---

### V. Case for Sovereign Independence
By adopting this framework, organizations can achieve **Sovereign Operational Safety**. This reduces dependency on large, opaque AI providers (colonial technology) by providing users the tools to monitor and manage their own risk vectors through open, mathematical standards.
