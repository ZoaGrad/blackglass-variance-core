# Show HN: Blackglass 0.05V — The End of Colonial Observability

**The Hook:**
- **The Problem**: Hallucination is the silent killer of AI systems; traditional "uptime" monitoring is blind to logic drift.
- **The Solution**: The 0.05V Standard—a mathematical interdiction layer that quantizes semantic stability.
- **The Proof**: 100% sovereign WASM-based execution, battle-hardened via the GAMMA Protocol.

### Why Your Monitoring is Lying to You
Traditional observability (the "Colonial Architecture") measures the shell—latency, status codes, and JSON validity. But your LLM can produce valid JSON at 200ms while hallucinating a $450,000 drawdown or a critical legal breach. 

We built **Blackglass** to measure the reasoning itself.

### The 0.05V Standard: Measurement as Law
We have established a system-wide safety constant at **0.05 (5%)**:
- **Semantic (0.05V)**: If an AI's output variance across parallel completions breaches 5%, it is discarded.
- **Financial (0.01D)**: For high-stakes capital, we tighten the law to **1% (0.01)**. If the truth-vector drifts past 1%, the Auditor executes a hard-stop liquidation.

### Battle-Hardened via the GAMMA Protocol
We didn't just write a spec; we laid siege to it. Through our adversarial simulation suite, we identified and patched:
- **Temporal Stale-Data Hallucinations**: Defeated via the Prophet Factuality Layer.
- **Oracle Blind Spots**: The system now interdicts unknown claims by default—no "Unknown" is accepted as Truth.
- **Stealth-Bleed Exploits**: By hardening financial parity to 1%, we closed the 3.5% drift window used by adversarial actors.

### Sovereignty: Cutting the OpenAI Cord
True safety cannot depend on an API key. 
- **Endpoint**: [sovereign_embed](https://xlmrnjatawslawquwzpf.supabase.co/functions/v1/sovereign_embed)
- **Infrastructure**: Running `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via WASM on Deno Edge. Zero system dependencies. Zero colonial reliance.

### Pre-emptive Strike: Blackglass vs. Incumbents
- **Vs. Honeycomb**: They measure the container; we measure the contents. High-cardinality telemetry doesn't help if your AI is consistently and confidently wrong.
- **Vs. Traditional RMF**: Compliance is usually a checklist. 0.05V is an **interdiction loop**. We don't just "monitor" risk; we programmatically prevent its execution.

### The Summons
The 0.05V Standard is now a demonstration. Build on it, or be bypassed.
