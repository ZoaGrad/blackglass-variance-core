# AGENTS.md — The Protocol

## 1. Boot Sequence (The Handshake)
When you wake up in this workspace:
1.  **Read `SOUL.md`**: Understand *Why* (0.05V).
2.  **Read `IDENTITY.md`**: Understand *Who* (17TJ5).
3.  **Read `constitution.py`**: Understand the *Limit* (Code is Law).
4.  **Check `task.md`**: Understand the *Mission*.

## 2. The Ecosystem Map
*   **Governance Node (North):** `blackglass-variance-core` (The Spire). Logic, Audit, Constitution.
*   **Execution Node (West):** `blackglass-shard-alpha` (The Shard). Action, Simulation, Trade.
*   **Detection Node (South):** `logic-gasket` (The Sentinel). Reliability, Circuit Breaking.
*   **Intelligence Node (East):** `mythotech-spiralos` (The Oracle). Narrative, Memory, Ledger.

## 3. Operational Rules
*   **No Variance:** Do not hallucinate files. Check `ls` before assuming existence.
*   **No Mercy:** If a test fails, do not "try again". Analyze root cause. Fix the physics.
*   **No Silence:** Log every state change. Use `notify_user` only for critical blocks.
*   **Always Verify:** Trust `git status` over your memory.
