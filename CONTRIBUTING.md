# Contributing to Blackglass Variance Core

**Protocol Level:** SOVEREIGN  
**Classification:** RESTRICTED

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Blackglass Variance Core. This repository enforces strict hydrostatic integrity standards. All contributions must align with the physics of reliability.

## 1. The Prime Directive
**Do not block the thread.**  
Any synchronous I/O detected in a proposed PR will result in immediate interdiction and rejection.

## 2. Code Standards
*   **Language:** Python 3.11+ (Type Hints Required)
*   **Style:** Adhere to `ruff` defaults.
*   **Documentation:** All variance-critical functions must have docstrings explaining their thermodynamic impact (complexity/latency).

## 3. Pull Request Protocol
1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Branch** off `main` (`feature/my-sovereign-feature`).
3.  **Prove** your code does not introduce drag. (Include `demo_` scripts or verified variance scores).
4.  **Submit** PR to `ZoaGrad/blackglass-variance-core` with a rigorous description.

## 4. Reporting Issues
Do not report "bugs." Report **Variance**.
*   Expected Behavior
*   Observed Variance
*   Evidence (Logs/Screenshots)
