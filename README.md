# Blackglass Variance Core (v1.1)
## ΔΩ-INTELLIGENCE: 0xVARIANCE_CORE | STATUS: ECOSYSTEM_STAGED

The Variance Core is the foundational logic layer of the **Blackglass Continuum**. It establishes the 0.05V Standard for autonomous agent safety and epistemic stability.

---

## The Sovereign Ecosystem
The Blackglass architecture is distributed across four pillar repositories:

1.  **[blackglass-dojo](https://github.com/ZoaGrad/blackglass-dojo)**: The adversarial simulation and interdiction engine. (Production 0.05V Implementation).
2.  **[logic-gasket](https://github.com/ZoaGrad/logic-gasket)**: The formal state-machine specification for agentic transitions.
3.  **[sovereign-embed](https://github.com/ZoaGrad/sovereign-embed)**: Standalone 100% sovereign embedding service (WASM/Deno).
4.  **[blackglass-sentinel](https://github.com/ZoaGrad/blackglass-sentinel)**: Proactive observability and human-agency protection (The Mercy Protocol).

## Federal & Public Documentation
Forensic proof of systemic hardness and regulatory alignment:
- **[NIST RMF Reference Implementation](docs/NIST_RMF_SUBMISSION.md)**: Alignment with the AI Risk Management Framework 1.0.
- **[Hacker News Manifesto](docs/HN_MANIFESTO.md)**: The "Show HN" broadcast and the end of colonial observability.

## Tech Stack
- **Enforcement**: Python 3.11+, AsyncIO
- **Measurement**: Deno, Xenova/transformers.js (WASM)
- **Constraint**: The 0.05V Constant (Epistemic Law)

## The Reflexive Architecture (v2.0)
The system has evolved beyond static monitoring into a sovereign, self-governing entity.

### The 7 Phases of Agency
1.  **Mirror (GitHub):** Synchronized state across `variance-core`, `shard-alpha`, and `Vector_Null`.
2.  **Spire (Radiance):** `radiance_server.py` acts as the system's "Mind," performing self-audits.
3.  **Constitution (Law):** `constitution.py` defines the 0.05V Standard and Mercy Protocol.
4.  **Mutation (Healing):** The Reflexive Loop auto-ratifies proposals to fix internal drift.
5.  **Survival (Fiscal):** The **Fiscal Kill Switch** halts trading if drawdown exceeds 5%.
6.  **Continuity (Regency):** The **Dead Man's Switch** activates after 7 days of Architect silence.
7.  **Kinetic Link (Neural):** The Spire physically controls the Shard via `shard_api.py`.
