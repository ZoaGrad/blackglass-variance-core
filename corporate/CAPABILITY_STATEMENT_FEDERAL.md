### CORE CAPABILITIES

**1. Deterministic Fault-Tolerant Systems**
Blackglass Continuum specializes in high-frequency automated systems with mathematically enforced circuit breakers. Our proprietary Substrate Health Guard monitors network conditions with 91-second hibernation triggers to preserve operational integrity during contested network environments.

**2. Contested Logistics Computing**
Architected for degraded communications environments, our systems operate autonomously with 45ms consensus quorums that exceed human reaction latency. Suitable for tactical edge computing and satellite-uplink operations requiring deterministic failover protocols.

**3. Cryptographic Evidence Management**
Immutable HMAC-SHA256 chained audit trails for all system decisions. NIST 800-171 Rev. 2 compliant logging with non-repudiation guarantees and automated forensic integrity verification.

**4. Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) Defense**
Advanced variance detection algorithms for financial anomaly detection and automated market making. Systems deployed on Layer 2 blockchain networks with sub-100ms execution latency.
