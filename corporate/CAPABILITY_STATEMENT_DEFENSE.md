## CORE COMPETENCIES
Blackglass Continuum LLC provides **Deterministic Mesh Computing & Cryptographic Evidence Systems** for high-stakes environments. We specialize in **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)** and **Automated Risk Management Framework (RMF)** integration for decentralized edge networks.

*   **Deterministic Autonomous Systems:** Deployment of self-governing agent meshes with <45ms consensus latency (Judicial Quorum technology).
*   **High-Frequency Signal Processing:** Automated ingestion and normalization of chaotic data streams (OracleHunter™ architecture).
*   **Cryptographic Audit Trails:** Immutable, HMAC-SHA256 chained logging for non-repudiation and forensic accountability (NIST 800-171 AU-3 compliant).
*   **Resilient Edge Computing:** Self-healing network protocols with automated hibernation triggers during substrate degradation (Substrate Health Guard).

## DIFFERENTIATORS
*   **Adversarial Resilience (Live-Fire Financial Testing):** Our systems are "pressure-forged" in adversarial live-fire financial markets, demonstrating 99.9% uptime under high-volatility conditions.
*   **Zero-Trust by Design:** Our "Vector_Null" authority matrix enforces strict separation between autonomous optimization cycles and executive command boundaries.
*   **Rapid Deployment:** Our "Shard Factory" containerization allows for the rapid spawning of specialized, mission-specific agent clones.

## PAST PERFORMANCE
*   **Project Variance Core (Internal R&D):** Successfully deployed a sovereign MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) extraction node on Base L2 Mainnet. Achieved <100ms end-to-end latency with zero-knowledge verification.
*   **Project SpiralOS:** Development of a deterministic, self-hosting kernel for decentralized logistics.

## COMPANY DATA
Blackglass Continuum LLC is a U.S.-based technology firm dedicated to the advancement of sovereign computing infrastructure.
*   **Headquarters:** [City, State]
*   **Structure:** Limited Liability Company (transitioning to C-Corp)
*   **Socio-Economic Status:** Small Business
