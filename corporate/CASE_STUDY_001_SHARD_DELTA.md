# CASE STUDY 001: THE IRON DOME PROTOCOL
**SUBJECT:** Shard Delta (Autonomous Trading Agent)
**TEST INTERVAL:** Jan 1, 2022 – Dec 31, 2022 (The "Crypto Winter")

---

## 1.0 THE CHALLENGE
Survivability in a High-Variance Environment.
* **Context:** In 2022, the Bitcoin market collapsed from ~$47k to ~$16k.
* **Objective:** Deploy an autonomous agent with a mandate to **Preserve Principal** above all else.
* **Constraint:** The agent must operate without human intervention, relying solely on its internal "Constitution" (Strategy.md) and "Auditor" (South Node).

## 2.0 THE ARCHITECTURE
We deployed **Shard Delta**, a fractal instance of the Blackglass Diamond Protocol™.
* **The Will (North Node):** Mandated a Hard Stop at 5% Drawdown.
* **The Auditor (South Node):** Equipped with **Active Interdiction** protocols (The Kill Switch).
* **The Logic:** If Drawdown ≥ 5%, `FORCE_SELL` and `LOCK` immediately.

## 3.0 THE EXECUTION (SIMULATION LOGS)
* **Jan 01 - Feb 17:** Market volatility increases. Shard attempts trend-following, incurring minor slippage.
* **Feb 18:** Portfolio Drawdown breaches **5.0%**.
* **The Interdiction:**
    * The Auditor detects the breach (Physics-Based Detection).
    * **Action:** `FORCE_SELL` triggered instantly.
    * **State Change:** System moves to `LOCKED` status.
* **Feb 19 - Dec 31:**
    * Market collapses -60% further.
    * The Shard's "Predictor" (AI) signals multiple "Buy the Dip" entries.
    * The Auditor **VETOES** every attempt due to `LOCKED` status.

## 4.0 THE RESULTS

| Metric | Buy & Hold (Benchmark) | Shard Delta (Blackglass) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Final Return** | **-64.3%** | **-5.6%** |
| **Capital Preserved** | 35.7% | **94.4%** |
| **Operational State** | Liquidated / Catastrophic | **Secure / Mothballed** |

## 5.0 CONCLUSION
The Diamond Protocol successfully demonstrated **Sovereign Interdiction**. By decoupling the "Desire to Trade" (AI) from the "Authority to Trade" (Auditor), the system prevented catastrophic loss.
This validates the Blackglass core competency: **Deterministic Reliability in Chaos.**
