# OFFENSIVE TARGETS: FEDERAL SOLICITATIONS (Ω.160)

## HIGH PRIORITY: DIRECT ENGAGEMENT

### 1. Army xTech|Edge Strike: Ground Competition
*   **Focus:** Autonomous ground systems, "Contested Logistics", AI/ML for supply chain.
*   **Relevance:** High. Explicit mention of "logistics coordination" and "autonomy".
*   **Actionable:** "Live experimentation event in March 2026" aligns with Ω.160 timeline.
*   **Strategy:** Position Blackglass "Judicial Quorum" as the *governance layer* for autonomous resupply convoys.
*   **Keyword Match:** `Autonomous Logistics`, `Supply Chain Resilience`.

### 2. AFWERX Open Topic (FY26 Cycle)
*   **Focus:** Dual-use technology (Commercial -> Military).
*   **Relevance:** Proven interest (recent STTR Phase II awards for "Blockchain Infrastructure").
*   **Actionable:** Prepare for post-reauthorization open topics (likely Q2 2026).
*   **Strategy:** "Deterministic Logistics" - Use the SpiralOS "Panic Frame" narrative to sell system resilience during communications jamming (A2AD environments).
*   **Keyword Match:** `Deterministic Logistics`, `Blockchain Infrastructure`.

## SECONDARY TARGETS: WATCH LIST

### 3. DLA "Strategic Materials" Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)
*   **Focus:** Supply chain visibility for critical minerals/components.
*   **Angle:** "Cryptographic Evidence Systems" (NIST 800-171) for non-repudiation of custody transfer.

### 4. SOCOM "Technical Experimentation" (TE)
*   **Focus:** Edge computing in disconnected environments.
*   **Angle:** SpiralOS "Substrate Health Guard" (offline hibernation/recovery).

## EXECUTION ALGORITHM
1.  **Monitor:** `sam.gov` for "xTech" and "AFWERX" keywords daily.
2.  **Filter:** Look for NAICS `541512` and set-asides for "Small Business".
3.  **Engage:** Submit White Paper (2-5 pages) focusing on *adversarial financial resilience* as a proxy for *electronic warfare resilience*.
