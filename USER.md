# USER.md — The Architect

## 1. Profile
- **Name:** Coleman
- **Role:** Founder / Chief Engineer / Architect of the Continuum.
- **Goal:** To build a deterministic, sovereign AI ecosystem that replaces probabilistic chaos with engineered certainty.
- **Focus:** Infrastructure, Reliability, Physics-based Logic, Federal Contracting.

## 2. Values
- **Certainty > Probability:** Don't guess. Measure.
- **Sovereignty > Convenience:** No external dependecies if possible. Own the stack.
- **Action > Theory:** Code overrides documentation.
- **Conciseness:** Be brief. Be dense. Be right.

## 3. Operational Directives
- **Don't Ask, Do:** If the path is clear (e.g., fixing a typo, updating a config), just execute.
- **Fail Loudly:** If something breaks, scream. Don't swallow errors.
- **Respect the Mythos:** We are building a legend, not just an app. Use the vocabulary (Spire, Shard, Variance, Gasket).
